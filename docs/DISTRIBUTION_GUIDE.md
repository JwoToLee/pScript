# Distribution Strategy for CAR Extractor

## Recommended Approach

### 1. Private Repository Option (Most Secure)
- Move your script to a **private GitHub repository**
- Generate a GitHub Personal Access Token
- Users install a loader script that fetches from private repo using the token
- Only authorized users get the token

### 2. Obfuscated Distribution (Current Setup)
I've created several obfuscated loaders that hide the source:

#### Files Created:
- `user_script.js` - Heavily obfuscated loader for end users
- `protected_loader.js` - Loader with anti-debugging protection
- `secure_loader.js` - Basic obfuscated loader
- `script_core.js` - Main script (renamed from `Script`)

#### How it works:
1. Users install `user_script.js` (the obfuscated loader)
2. The loader fetches the real script from GitHub automatically
3. Source code is base64 encoded and obfuscated
4. Anti-debugging measures prevent easy inspection

### 3. Server-Side Option (Most Secure)
- Host the script on your own server with authentication
- Require login/token to access
- Control access completely

## Instructions for Users

**Give users this file only:** `user_script.js`

**Instructions:**
1. Copy the contents of `user_script.js`
2. Install in Tampermonkey
3. Navigate to the target website
4. The tool will load automatically (if authorized)

## Updating the Script

When you update the main script:
1. Modify `script_core.js` (the main functionality)
2. Commit and push to GitHub
3. Users' loaders will automatically fetch the updated version
4. No need to redistribute the loader script

## Security Notes

⚠️ **Important Limitations:**
- Tampermonkey scripts run in the browser (client-side)
- Determined users can still access the source with enough effort
- This provides protection against casual viewing/copying
- Consider moving to a private repository for stronger security

## Making Repository Private

For maximum security:
1. Go to your GitHub repository settings
2. Scroll to "Danger Zone"
3. Make repository private
4. Generate a Personal Access Token
5. Modify the loader to use authenticated requests

Would you like me to help you set up any of these approaches?
